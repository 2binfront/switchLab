Switchyard
==========

Switchyard (or "switchy") is a low-level networking library for software switches/routers in Python.  Intended for use in layer2-/layer3-oriented labs and projects in computer networking courses.

Documentation is available at http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/switchyard
Documentation is written using the Python Sphinx package; doc sources are
available in the documentation directory.

Switchyard can run in a standalone test mode, in a simulation environment with a nice little command-line interface, or also within a Linux host and or in Mininet.  This version of Switchyard is a complete overhaul of the original framework written in late 2013.  Many parts of the code are under active development and very little is presently documented.  For the older version of Switchyard, see the v1 branch.  Importantly, this version of Switchyard requires Python 3.4.
