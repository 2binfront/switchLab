Switchyard
==========

Switchyard (or "switchy") is a low-level networking library for software switches/routers in Python (version 2).  Intended for use in layer2-/layer3-oriented labs and projects in computer networking courses.

This version of Switchyard makes use of the [POX Openflow controller](https://github.com/noxrepo/pox) platform for packet parsing libraries, and other functions.  Switchyard can run in a standalone test mode, or also nicely within Mininet.  The [Mininet project](http://www.mininet.org) pages have documentation for Mininet, as well as lots of other good stuff.

There is some [documentation](https://docs.google.com/a/colgate.edu/document/d/1ZT8jKr1vDWsSg12Bf63qcKMxyncIVJGwTLCUY140tWg/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Doc) for this version of switchyard, but development on this version (v1) has ceased; work has shifted to version 2 (v2 branch), which requires Python 3 but has very few external dependencies.
