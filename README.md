Switchyard
==========

Switchyard (or "switchy") is a low-level networking library for software switches/routers in Python.  Intended for use in layer2-/layer3-oriented labs and projects in computer networking courses.

There is some [documentation](https://github.com/jsommers/switchyard/wiki) in the Github wiki for Switchyard, though note that it is a work in progress and is only geared to Switchyard v1 (which is on the master branch, currently).

Switchyard can run in a standalone test mode, in a simulation environment with a nice little command-line interface, or also nicely within a Linux host and as a result, within Mininet.  The [Mininet project](http://www.mininet.org) pages have documentation for Mininet, as well as lots of other good stuff.

This is the v2 branch of Switchyard, which is a complete overhaul of the original framework and is, at best, in alpha form.  Many parts of the code are under active development and very little is presently documented.  In other words, unless you are me, you probably shouldn't be using this code (yet).

Importantly, the v2 branch requires Python 3.4.  Don't leave home without it.
