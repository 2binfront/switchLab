Exercises 
*********

Hub
  This is mainly a walkthrough of Switchyard, including an overview
  of its operation, the structure of Switchyard programs, and an intro
  to its APIs.

Learning switch
  This exercise takes the simple hub and adds learning switch capabilities
  to it.  I think it's a nice follow-on to the hub exercise.

IP router
  This is really a set of 3 exercises designed to gradually built up
  capabilities to implement an IPv4 router that uses a static forwarding
  table (i.e., it has no dynamic routing capabilities).

Router firewall
  This exercise adds a rate-limiting firewall capability onto the IP
  router.

UDP network stack (TBD)
  This exercise is an introduction to using Switchyard's socket 
  API emulation capabilities.  The goal is to build the Ethernet/IP/UDP
  layers to support a UDP-based application.

TCP network stack (TBD)
  The goal of this exercise is to build the Ethernet/IP/TCP 
  layers to support a TCP-based socket application.  The TCP
  implementation is simplified from a "real" TCP, but can still be
  used to communicate with a "real" TCP remote endpoint.
